When your team is sharing a pool of GPUs, usual practice is to do `nvidia-smi` and assign a free GPU (one with more unused RAM) to your program. Instead, you can include the following snippet to do it.

```
pip install pynvml
```

```python
import pynvml                                                           
pynvml.nvmlInit()                                                       

# Count the number of GPU devices
num_devices = pynvml.nvmlDeviceGetCount() 

# List to store the GPU-RAM remaining in each gpu device
storage_details = [] 

for dvcidx in range(num_devices): 
    # Create a handler/object of the ith-GPU
    h = pynvml.nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex(dvcidx)
    # Get its info
    info = pynvml.nvmlDeviceGetMemoryInfo(h)
     # Convert to GB 
    free = (info.free)/(1024*1024*1024)
    storage_details.append(free)


# Sort the GPU indices in descending order of Unused GPU memory
storage_details_indices = sorted(range(len(storage_details)),\ 
                                 key=lambda k: storage_details[k],
                                 reverse=True)

```

Include this snippet in your modelling script and select the GPU devices from the variable `storage_details_indices`.
